// What an account may do before anyone has proven its email address.
//
// Sign-up is open, and the address is not confirmed at sign-up. So an
// unconfirmed account may have been opened by someone who is NOT the owner of
// the address: sign up with a member's (or a GOD_EMAILS) address before they
// ever do, and wait. Better Auth guards the Google half of that pre-account
// takeover itself (`requireLocalEmailVerified`, see config.ts). This plugin
// guards the rest:
//
// 1. No passkey and no two-factor until the address is confirmed. Either one
//    would outlive the owner's password reset: the reset revokes sessions but
//    leaves passkeys and the TOTP secret in place, so a squatter's passkey
//    would still sign in, and a squatter's TOTP would lock the owner out.
// 2. A valid reset link for an unconfirmed account clears the passkeys and
//    two-factor enrolled on it. Whoever holds the link holds the inbox, which
//    is the one thing the enroller never proved. (Enrolments made before rule
//    1 existed are why this is still needed.)
// 3. A verification link never skips two-factor. With
//    `autoSignInAfterVerification`, Better Auth's /verify-email opens a brand
//    new session for a browser that had none, and the twoFactor plugin only
//    challenges /sign-in/*. So for an account with two-factor on, the fresh
//    session is taken back: the address is confirmed, and the member signs in
//    the normal way, code and all. A browser already signed in to that
//    account keeps its session (Better Auth only refreshes its cookie).
